# Build-a-boat.0
Roblox studio file. I made a working build-system same how in game "Build a boat for treasure". In file you have some models, wich need to ungroup in folders(models names = place).
I thinked this project is original, because any time ago I have searched example for this game and.......NOTHING! hehehe
Spent not a lot of time, that means this project is not ready yet. Ofcourse, it have some errors, but they not critical(I promiss)
If it will get popularity, i will make a new versions and more things for this game


INFO ABOAT FILE:
  1.Workspace - put it and ungroup in Workspace. There I made a BuildPlace, floor, which need use for building
  2.ReplicatedStorage - put it and ungroup in ReplicatedStorage. In this folder place ALL objects, which by you want build 
  3. StarterGui - put it in StarterGui. This GUI shows you all selectable objects for building
  3.StarterPack - put it and ungroup in StarterPack. And finally, tool for building! R,T,Y - for rotation. Left mouse click - for build.
